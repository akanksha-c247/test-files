              Solid waste system changes are tough.
              <br /> Municipal solid waste managers traverse critique and
              criticism in driving
              <br /> through big changes, like automated collection or a new
              material stream for
              <br />
              collection. Collection system changes have far reaching
              expenditures for
              <br /> trucks, carts, facilities, etc. The purchasing decisions
              canâ€™t get it wrong. You
              <br /> must know how many trucks you will need.
              <br /> ROC can help. See why large cities like Atlanta and
              Sacramento down to small
              <br /> townships work with ROC. Realize your vision for building
              the best collection
              <br /> system your city has ever had.
